# Reinformence Learning Pong Agent


This project is created to train RL Agent to play Atari Pong Game using Policy Gradient methods from only raw input game pixels. 

Specifically, the Policy Gradient method I used for this agent is Proximal Policy Optimization

After 3 days of training, this Reinforcement Learning Pong Agent was able to beat the hardcoded Artificial Intelligence Pong Agent
